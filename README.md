# Capacitive Piano

Create your own fruit piano with this python script.  Place 12 apples on a table and create your own midi piano with light effects.

Here is a pumpkin piano I made for Halloween.  Any wet object, like fruits and vegatables will work, as well as metal objects like aluminium foil.

## Features

 * **Simultaneous key presses** Play 12 notes at the same time
 * **High quality audio** using .sf2 sound fonts and fluidsynth midi synthesizer
 * **Sustain** Hold down a piano key to sustain instruments like pipe organs
 * **Mode Switch** Connect an optional switch to at GPIO pin and switch between different instruments or even drum kits
 * **Light effects** Add neopixel lights and each piano key will light up when pressed

## Required Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 3
* [MPR121 12-key capacitive touch sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SK8PVNA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage)
* 12 conductive objects like fruit or aluminium foil
* Dupont wire jumper cables
* Breadboard
* Speaker (must be amplified, HDMI cable to TV/receiver sounds great, headphone jack has a little background noise but is tolerable)

## Neopixel Hardware
* Neopixel [string](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/50x-WS2812B-Pre-soldered-leds-with-wire-5V-WS2812-IC-Built-in-12cm-Wire-Addressable-Idividually/32243084800.html) or [strip](https://www.amazon.com/ALITOVE-Individually-Addressable-Flexible-Waterproof/dp/B01DLYSH6U) (addressable LEDs such as WS2812 lights)
* Neopixel power supply [see *Adafruit Powering NeoPixels* guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/powering-neopixels)
* [Logic level shifter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10pcs-lot-UART-SPI-4-Channel-IIC-I2C-Logic-Level-Converter-Bi-Directional-Module-5V-to/32805164795.html) to convert 3.3v to 5v. **Required** for driving neopixels from a 3.3v source like a Raspberry Pi.
* [Capacitor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/20PCS-25V-1000UF-Aluminum-electrolytic-capacitor-25-V-1000-UF-25V-1000UF-size-10-17mm/32725883192.html) (1000 µF, 6.3V or higher) to protect the neopixels from being damaged by initial onrush of current

## Optional Hardware
* Momentary button (if switching between multiple instruments)
* 10k resistor

## Software Libraries
* [Adafruit_MPR121](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121) 12-key capacitive touch sensor
* [python-mingus](http://bspaans.github.io/python-mingus/) midi synthesizer
* [rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) neopixel lights

# Usage
* Install the above software libraries
* Edit piano.py
	* fluidsynth.init('path/to/your/soundfont.sf2')
	* LED_COUNT = (number of neopixels)
	* LED_STRIP = (type of neopixel strip)
	* lightSegments = (array of which neopixels should illuminate for each key)
* run ``` sudo python piano.py ``` from terminal
(Sudo is required for python to access the GPIO pins)

### Automatically Run at Startup
* Install [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
* ``` sudo pm2 start piano.py ```
* ``` sudo pm2 save ```
* ```sudo reboot ```
* piano.py will run at startup, neopixels will blink orange when piano is ready

# Tips
* For best touch sensitivity, minimize distance between fruit and capacitive touch sensor.  For small fruit like apples, no more than two or three feet.  For large objects like pumpkins, 8 inches or less.  Instead of placing the capacitive touch sensor on the breadboard, run long wires (I used cat5 cable) from the breadboard to the table with your fruit, then wire up the capacitive touch sensor as close as possible to the fruit.
* Protect your neopixels with a capacitor and read the [*Adafruit NeoPixel Überguide - Powering Neopixels section](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/powering-neopixels)
